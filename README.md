# Catro/Modulo modules for VCV Rack

CM-1: 8xlfo
8 LFOs that blend between sine, square, saw and triangle waves
Rate is from very slow to audio rate
Mix output is the average of all LFOs

CM-2: 8xatn
8 attenuverters with offset
Mix output is the average of all outputs that have an input connected

CM-3: PreSetSeq
Preset sequencer and morpher 
8 'Eyes' that set their value when no input connected, or scale the input when connected.
8 triggerable record buttons that save the resulting eye-values
Scan/select dial to choose which saved recording to select for output
Morph slider fades between recording output, direct eye output and recordingXdirect output
Sequencer with some built-in patterns and basic controls
Don't press the "Try me"-button! ;)

## TODO:

-CM-1: add row copy down buttons

-CM-2: move patterns to external file so users can create their own patterns (maybe create a separate pattern maker module?)

(Manual for all modules will appear here in the future.)
